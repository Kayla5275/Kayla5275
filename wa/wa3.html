                The show revolves around the adventures of three kindergarten-aged girls with an array of various superpowers: Blossom (pink), Bubbles (blue), and Buttercup (green). The plot of an episode is usually some humorous variation of standard superhero and tokusatsu shows, with the girls using their powers to defend their town from villains and giant monsters. In addition, the girls have to deal with the normal issues that young children face, such as sibling rivalries, loose teeth, personal hygiene, going to school, bed wetting, or dependence on a security blanket. Episodes often contain hidden references to older pop culture (especially noticeable in the episode "Meet the Beat Alls", which is a homage to the Beatles). The cartoon always tries to keep different ideas within each episode with some small tributes and parodies thrown in.

                The show is set mainly in the city of Townsville, USA. Townsville is depicted as a major American city, with a cityscape consisting of several major skyscrapers. In his review of The Powerpuff Girls Movie, movie critic Bob Longino of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said, "the intricate drawings emanate 1950s futuristic pizzazz like a David Hockney scenescape," and that the show is "one of the few American creations that is both gleeful pop culture and exquisite high art."

            <p style="text-indent: 25px">As depicted in the opening sequence of each episode, the Powerpuff Girls Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup were created by Professor Utonium in an attempt to create the "perfect little girl" using a mixture of "sugar, spice, and everything nice". However, he accidentally spilled a mysterious substance called "Chemical X" into the mixture, creating three girls and granting them superpowers, including flight, superhuman strength, superhuman speed, superhuman senses, limited invulnerability, x-ray vision, red heat vision, energy projection, space survivability, and thermal resistance. In the original concept, the accidental substance was a can of "Whoopass", which was replaced by "Chemical X" in the television show.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 25px">The three girls all have abnormally large eyes inspired by Margaret Keane's art, and stubby arms and legs, and lack of noses, ears, fingers, flat feet, toes, and necks. McCracken preferred them to look more symbolic of actual children rather than going for a "realistic" look, meaning fewer body parts were needed. Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup normally wear dresses that match the colors of their eyes with black stripes, as well as white stockings and black Mary Janes. They individually represent body, mind and spirit, and despite being the same age, they adopt the characteristics of the oldest, middle and youngest child. The closing theme song offers a nutshell description of their personalities: Blossom, commander and the leader. Bubbles, she is the joy and the laughter. Buttercup, she is the toughest fighter.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Blossom (voiced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy_Cavadini">Cathy Cavadini</a>) is the self-appointed leader of the Powerpuff Girls. Her personality ingredient is "everything nice", her signature color is pink, and she has long red-orange hair with a red bow. She was named for having spoken freely and honestly to the Professor shortly after her creation, as shown in The Powerpuff Girls Movie. She often behaves as the most level-headed and composed member of the group, with a strong and determined attitude. Her unique abilities include ice breath, microscopic vision, lightning bolts, and advanced intelligence. As the leader, she is a master strategist and apt planner, so she figures everything out and keeps control of the situations.</li>
                <li>Bubbles (voiced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tara_Strong">Tara Strong</a> in the series) is the "softest and sweetest" of the three. She is the most innocent and childish, as she most enjoys the regular occupations of any child, such as playing games and coloring. Her personality ingredient is "sugar", her signature color is blue, and she has blonde hair in pigtails. Bubbles is kind and sweet, but she is also capable of extreme rage and fights just as well as her sisters. She loves animals and her best friend is a stuffed octopus doll she calls "Octi". She has the ability to both understand multiple languages and communicate with various animals. Her unique powers are projecting powerful sonic screams, and creating a shockwave of thunder with a single clap from her hands.</li>
                <li>Buttercup (voiced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._G._Daily">E. G. Daily</a>) is described as a "tough hotheaded tomboy". Her personality ingredient is "spice", her signature color is green, and she has short black hair in a bob cut. She loves to fight hard, play rough and get dirty; she does not plan and only wants to punish the bad guys instead of solving the crimes. Her unique powers are curling her tongue, spinning into a tornado, and creating fireballs by rubbing her hands together until smoke comes out. This action forms a flaming ball that she throws at an opponent. McCracken originally wanted to name the character "Bud", until a friend suggested the name Buttercup.</li>
