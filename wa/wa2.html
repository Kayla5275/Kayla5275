        <p>I am a second year CTD student graduating in <strong>2026</strong>. I plan on working in the immersive reality field or sound engineering after I graduate. I love the CTD program and the opportunities it has opened up for me.</p>
        <p>My goal for this class is to eventually be able to code my portfolio. I have some experience with HTML and CSS, but I want to get better at javascript. I like seeing my projects come to life, so I'm really excited to see what websites I create.</p>

        <p>My favorite YouTube video is a short film called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p4s4k3eB_I&list=LL&index=132">Gruff</a> because I got to see all the effort put into making the film through videos from the creator.</p>
